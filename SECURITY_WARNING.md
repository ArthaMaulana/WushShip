# ðŸš¨ SECURITY WARNING

**IMPORTANT: This repository previously contained exposed API keys and JWT tokens!**

## What Happened
- Supabase URL and anon key were accidentally committed to version control
- JWT tokens were exposed in the git history
- This is a serious security vulnerability

## Actions Taken
1. âœ… Credentials removed from current codebase
2. âœ… .gitignore updated to prevent future exposure
3. âœ… .env.example created for safe configuration
4. ðŸ”„ **TODO**: Revoke/regenerate all exposed keys in Supabase Dashboard

## For Developers
**NEVER** commit these to Git:
- API keys
- JWT tokens
- Database credentials
- Any sensitive configuration

## Safe Practices
1. Use environment variables (.env files)
2. Add sensitive files to .gitignore
3. Use flutter_secure_storage for tokens
4. Keep .env.example with dummy values only

## Current Status
- Application uses MockAuthService for development
- Production requires proper environment setup
- All sensitive data must be configured outside of version control

## Next Steps
1. Regenerate Supabase keys in dashboard
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Review entire codebase for any missed credentials
4. Consider git history cleanup if needed
